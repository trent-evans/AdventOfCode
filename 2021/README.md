# Advent of Code 2021 #

This year at the suggestion of a friend, I decided to do [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) again.  I wasn't very successful last year, but this year I want to try and do the whole thing.  I've been wanting to write more Go in my life (I mostly write C# at work), so I decided that I was going to do the Advent in Go this year.  

Generally speaking, what I have in here is probably the end solution, with maybe a few commits in the middle.
